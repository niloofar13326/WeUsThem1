"# weusthem_project" 
in this app i used python and the framework django, if you enter the folder LEAD_MANAGER_REACT_DJANGO and then open the leadmanager, run "python manager runserver", open the localhost and add "api/leads/"
at the end of page you can see a form that is contain name, email, phone number.
byfilling the form, it added to list of contact.
I used rest api todo this project.
I know I couldn't fullfill all the request questions, but I try to do my best. I really don't know the .node.js and the javascript, but if you give me this opportunity I can show my talent and my ability in broader way.I am also a fast learner who can changes ideas to oportunities. thank you in advanced
